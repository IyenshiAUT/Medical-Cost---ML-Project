        "When predicting medical costs using the Medical Cost Personal Datasets, it is essential to use performance metrics that provide a comprehensive evaluation of the regression model's accuracy and effectiveness. Here are some of the best performance metrics for this dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
        "MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is useful for understanding the average error in dollar terms, which is intuitive and easy to interpret.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} | y_i - \\hat{y}_i |\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
        "MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors. It emphasizes larger errors due to the squaring term, making it useful for highlighting models that perform poorly on outliers.\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "In additionally to that, we are using Root Mean Squared Erro and consider it as the main performance metric in this model.\n",
        "\n",
        "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is an important metric for evaluating regression models, including linear regression models like Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net. Here's why RMSE is particularly useful in comparing the performance of these models:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Interpretability**: RMSE provides an intuitive measure of how well the model's predictions align with the actual target values. It represents the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values, expressed in the same units as the target variable. This makes it easy to interpret and communicate the model's performance to stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sensitivity to Errors**: RMSE penalizes large prediction errors more heavily than smaller errors due to the squaring operation. This property makes RMSE particularly sensitive to outliers or large errors, which is important for identifying cases where the model performs poorly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Direct Comparison**: RMSE allows for direct comparison of models' predictive accuracy. Lower RMSE values indicate better model performance, while higher RMSE values suggest poorer performance. Therefore, when comparing different regression models, the one with the lower RMSE is generally preferred as it makes more accurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use in Cross-Validation**: RMSE is often used as the evaluation metric in cross-validation procedures, including in `GridSearchCV`. By optimizing models based on RMSE during hyperparameter tuning, we aim to select the model configuration that minimizes prediction errors across different folds of the data, leading to better generalization performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Relative Performance**: In the context of comparing Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression models, RMSE serves as a reliable metric for assessing their relative performance. Since these models have different regularization mechanisms (L1, L2, or a combination), comparing their RMSE values allows us to understand how well they generalize to new data and whether one regularization approach outperforms the others for the specific dataset.\n"
